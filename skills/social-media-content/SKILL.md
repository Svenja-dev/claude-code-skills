# Social Media Content

Platform-optimized content creation for B2B marketing in manufacturing and Industry 4.0.

## LinkedIn

**Best Times:** Tue-Thu 8-10 AM, 5-6 PM (local time)

**Rules:**
- First line = Hook (attention grabber)
- No links in post body (put in comments - boosts reach)
- 3-5 Hashtags: #Manufacturing #Industry40 #SmartFactory #OEE #DigitalTransformation
- CTA at the end (ask a question to drive engagement)

**Format Template:**
```
[HOOK - 1 sentence that stops the scroll]

[3-5 bullet points with value]

[CTA Question]

---
[Link in first comment]
[Hashtags in first comment]
```

**Example:**
```
We reduced unplanned downtime by 47% in 6 weeks.

Here's what actually worked:

- Real-time OEE monitoring (not just reports)
- Anomaly detection before operators notice
- Shift-based performance comparison
- AI-powered root cause analysis

The biggest insight? 80% of quality issues traced back to 3 machines.

What's your biggest challenge with production visibility?

## X/Twitter

**Rules:**
- Under 200 characters performs better
- Max 2 hashtags (Twitter penalizes hashtag spam)
- Use threads for complex topics (first tweet = hook)
- Avoid links in main tweet (kills algorithmic reach)
- Put links in replies

**Example:**
```
We analyzed 50,000 production records.

The #1 cause of quality issues? Not machines.

It's the handoff between shifts.

## Reddit

**CRITICAL: NO direct advertising!**

Reddit users hate promotional content. Get banned fast if obvious.

**Relevant Subreddits:**
- r/manufacturing
- r/PLC
- r/industrialengineering
- r/ClaudeAI (for technical AI setups)
- r/SaaS (for business discussions)

**Strategy:**
1. **Value first** - Answer questions genuinely, share knowledge
2. **Build karma** - Participate for weeks before mentioning anything
3. **Share learnings** - "Here's how we solved X" (not "try our product")
4. **Mention products only when directly relevant** and helpful
5. **Never self-promote in titles** - "We built..." is instant downvote

**Good Example:**
```
Title: How we reduced CSV analysis time from 2 hours to 10 seconds

Post: We had a recurring problem analyzing SECOM semiconductor data...
[Technical explanation with value]
[What we learned]

If anyone's interested, we open-sourced the sampling algorithm /
built a tool for this (link in comments if curious).
```

## Discord

**Rules:**
- Casual, helpful tone
- No promotional links (ever)
- Help others first, consistently
- Build reputation over months
- Share code snippets, not product pitches

**Good channels:**
- Claude AI Discord
- Vercel Discord
- Manufacturing/PLC Discords
